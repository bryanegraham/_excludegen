_excludegen
-------------------
Plugin for FlashDevelop4 that generates _exclude files for you from a simple gui.

# Holy Cow this is old as heck
I know! I wrote this back in 2012 because it was a bit of a pain for what I was doing at the time.

This would have just been left alone were it not for BitBucket discontinuing mercurial support.

# So this project is dead?
Yeah pretty much. I've no plans to maintain it, since it solves a very specific ActionScript 2 problem with large projects on an old version of Flash Develop. That said, if any of you poor saps are using AS2, and are having class overwrite issues. Feel free to drop me a line.

# Okay, cool, how does it work?
